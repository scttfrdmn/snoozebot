## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Every component will have comprehensive unit tests
- Mocks will be used to isolate components
- Edge cases and error conditions will be explicitly tested
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions between components
- Use containerized testing where appropriate
- Test with simulated network conditions (latency, packet loss)

### Cloud Integration Testing
- Create isolated testing environments in each cloud provider
- Use minimal resources to control costs
- Run tests against real cloud instances
- Clean up resources after tests
- Use recorded API responses for regular testing
- Periodic runs against real clouds to verify compatibility

### Performance Testing
- Benchmark resource monitoring overhead
- Test with varying system loads
- Measure communication overhead
- Test scalability with many monitored instances

## Development Environment

### Required Tools
- Go 1.18+
- Protocol Buffers compiler
- Docker for testing
- Cloud provider CLI tools
- Access to test cloud accounts

### Repository Structure
- `/pkg/monitor`: Embeddable monitoring library
- `/pkg/common`: Shared code
- `/agent`: Remote agent
- `/plugins`: Cloud provider plugins
- `/test`: Integration and system tests
- `/examples`: Example applications
- `/docs`: Documentation

## Release Strategy

### Release Cadence
- Alpha releases for early testing
- Beta releases for broader testing
- 1.0 release when stable and tested
- Regular feature releases thereafter

### Versioning
- Follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer)
- Major version bumps for breaking API changes
- Minor version bumps for new features
- Patch version bumps for bug fixes
