# Azure Plugin and Security Enhancements

## Summary
- Implements Azure cloud provider plugin with complete VM operations
- Adds comprehensive security system with authentication, TLS, and signatures
- Enhances the plugin architecture with security-focused features
- Provides detailed documentation and utility tools

## Changes Overview

### Azure Plugin Implementation
- Complete Azure plugin using Azure SDK for Go
- Support for VM operations (start, stop, get info)
- Integration with existing plugin architecture
- Documentation and examples for Azure plugin usage

### Authentication System
- API key-based authentication for plugins
- Role-based permission system for fine-grained access control
- Secure key generation and validation
- REST API endpoints for auth management

### TLS Communication
- Secure plugin communication with TLS
- Certificate generation and management
- Mutual TLS authentication for plugins
- Configuration options for TLS deployment

### Plugin Signature Verification
- Cryptographic signatures for plugin integrity
- Key management system for signing and verification
- Command-line tools for plugin signing
- Integration with existing security features

## Testing Done
- Unit tests for Azure plugin functionality
- Security testing for authentication system
- TLS communication testing
- Signature verification testing
- Integration testing with combined security features

## Documentation
- Added AUTHENTICATION_USAGE.md for auth system
- Added PLUGIN_TLS.md for TLS implementation
- Added PLUGIN_SIGNATURES.md for signature system
- Updated SECURITY.md with new features
- Created POST_MERGE_STEPS.md for follow-up tasks

## Future Work
These will be addressed after merging:
- Integration testing for all cloud providers
- Performance benchmarks for plugin system
- Versioned plugin APIs
- Plugin marketplace implementation

## Breaking Changes
None. All security features are opt-in and disabled by default.

## Reviewer Notes
- Please pay special attention to the security implementations
- The Azure plugin requires valid Azure credentials for full testing
- All security features can be tested independently
- Documentation should be reviewed for accuracy and completeness

## Test Plan
1. Run unit tests: `go test ./...`
2. Test Azure plugin with credentials:
   ```
   export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<subscription-id>
   export AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource-group>
   export AZURE_VM_NAME=<vm-name>
   ./scripts/test_azure_plugin.sh
   ```
3. Test security features:
   ```
   ./scripts/sign_plugins.sh
   ```
