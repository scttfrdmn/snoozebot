# Snoozebot Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of key features in Snoozebot.

## Notification System with Slack Integration

**Status**: Completed and pushed to main branch (May 2025)

**Description**: Added a comprehensive notification system to Snoozebot to enable sending alerts for critical events like idle instances, scheduled actions, and state changes. The implementation includes:

1. **Notification Framework**:
   - Core notification system with provider interface
   - Support for different notification types and severity levels
   - Notification manager to handle provider registration and message routing
   - Type package to eliminate import cycles

2. **Slack Integration**:
   - Slack webhook provider to send formatted messages to Slack channels
   - Message formatting with attachments, colors, and customizable appearance
   - Support for configuration via YAML files

3. **Agent Integration**:
   - Integration points in the agent API for key events
   - Notifications for idle instances, scheduled actions, and state changes
   - Proper error handling to ensure reliable server operation

4. **Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive documentation for the notification system architecture
   - Guide for setting up and configuring Slack integration
   - Sample configuration files and examples
   - Extensive troubleshooting guide for notification system issues

5. **Testing**:
   - Test script to verify Slack notification functionality

**Files Modified**:
- `agent/api/server.go`: Added notification manager and integration points
- `README.md`: Updated documentation to include notification features
- Added new files in `pkg/notification/` directory
- Added documentation in `docs/` directory
- Updated troubleshooting guide with notification system information

**Next Steps**:
- Add email notification provider
- Add notification filters and rate limiting for high-volume events
- Create a web-based notification dashboard

## API Versioning Implementation

**Status**: Completed (April 2025)

This section summarizes the implementation of the API versioning system for Snoozebot.

### Implemented Components

### API Version Management

- **Semantic Versioning**: Implemented SemVer (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for the plugin API
- **Current Version**: Set to 1.0.0
- **Version Parsing**: Utility functions to parse and compare versions
- **Compatibility Checking**: Logic to determine if plugin versions are compatible with the host

### Plugin Manifest System

- **Manifest Structure**: Created manifest data structure with version information, metadata, and capabilities
- **Manifest Storage**: Functions to save and load manifests
- **Manifest Discovery**: Utilities to find plugin manifests

### Base Provider Implementation

- **Common Functionality**: Created BaseProvider with shared functionality for all plugins
- **Version Support**: Added GetAPIVersion() and compatibility checking methods
- **Capability Management**: Support for tracking and querying plugin capabilities

### Protocol Definitions

- **Version Service**: Added gRPC service for version information exchange
- **API Version Method**: Added GetAPIVersion to the CloudProvider interface
- **Manifest Messages**: Added protobuf messages for manifest information

### AWS Plugin Update

- **API Version Support**: Added GetAPIVersion() method to return the current API version
- **Improved Implementation**: Updated plugin to better handle versioning

### Example and Documentation

- **Custom Plugin Example**: Created example plugin with full versioning support
- **API Versioning Documentation**: Comprehensive guide to the versioning system
- **README Updates**: Added version information to project documentation

### Tools and Scripts

- **Version Check Tool**: Command-line utility to check version compatibility
- **Interface Validator**: Tool to verify plugin interface implementation
- **Build Script**: Script to build all plugins with version information
- **Test Script**: Script to test plugin version compatibility

## Testing

- **Version Compatibility**: Tested compatibility between different versions
- **Manifest Management**: Tested creating, saving, and loading manifests
- **Plugin Integration**: Tested version checking during plugin loading

## Next Steps

- **Full Integration**: Update all plugins to use the new versioning system
- **CI Integration**: Add version compatibility checking to CI pipeline
- **Plugin Repository**: Begin work on plugin discovery and distribution system with version tracking

## Migration Path

- Existing plugins need to implement the GetAPIVersion() method
- No breaking changes for existing plugins
- Documentation provides clear migration guidance
