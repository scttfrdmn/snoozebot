# Compilation Fixes for Snoozebot 0.1.0

This document describes the compilation issues that were fixed as part of the 0.1.0 release preparation.

## Overview of Fixes

Three major issues were addressed:

1. **GetInstanceInfo Method in gRPC Implementation**: Fixed incorrect struct field mapping
2. **SecureConfig TLSConfig Field**: Removed incorrect field assignment
3. **Type Conflicts in Protocol Package**: Updated code to use protobuf-generated types consistently

## Detailed Fixes

### 1. GetInstanceInfo Method in gRPC Implementation

**Issue**: The `GetInstanceInfo` method in `pkg/plugin/grpc.go` was incorrectly setting fields directly on the `GetInstanceInfoResponse` struct rather than using the proper nested `InstanceInfo` field.

**Fix**: Updated the method to create and populate an `InstanceInfo` object and assign it to the `Instance` field of the response.

```go
// Before
func (m *GRPCCloudProviderServer) GetInstanceInfo(ctx context.Context, req *GetInstanceInfoRequest) (*GetInstanceInfoResponse, error) {
    // ...
    response := &GetInstanceInfoResponse{}
    response.Id = info.ID         // Error: Id is not a field of GetInstanceInfoResponse
    response.Name = info.Name     // Error: Name is not a field of GetInstanceInfoResponse
    // ...
}

// After
func (m *GRPCCloudProviderServer) GetInstanceInfo(ctx context.Context, req *GetInstanceInfoRequest) (*GetInstanceInfoResponse, error) {
    // ...
    instance := &InstanceInfo{
        Id:         info.ID,
        Name:       info.Name,
        // ...
    }
    
    return &GetInstanceInfoResponse{
        Instance: instance,
    }, nil
}
```

Also updated the corresponding client implementation to correctly access fields from the nested `Instance` object.

### 2. SecureConfig TLSConfig Field

**Issue**: The code in `pkg/plugin/tls_plugin.go` was trying to set a `TLSConfig` field on the `plugin.SecureConfig` struct, but this field doesn't exist in the HashiCorp go-plugin library.

**Fix**: Removed the incorrect field assignment and added a comment explaining the purpose of `SecureConfig`.

```go
// Before
clientConfig.SecureConfig = &plugin.SecureConfig{
    TLSConfig: p.TLSConfig,
}

// After
// Note: We're not setting SecureConfig here as it's used for binary verification
// and not for TLS configuration
```

### 3. Type Conflicts in Protocol Package

**Issue**: The `protocol` package had manually defined Go structs with camelCase field names (e.g., `InstanceID`), but the client code was using protobuf-generated types with mixed snake_case/camelCase fields (e.g., `InstanceId`).

**Fix**: Updated the `AgentClient` to explicitly import and use the protobuf-generated types from the `gen` package.

```go
// Before
import (
    // ...
)

// AgentClient is a client for communicating with the remote agent
type AgentClient struct {
    // ...
    client SnoozeAgentClient
    // ...
}

// After
import (
    // ...
    "github.com/scttfrdmn/snoozebot/pkg/common/protocol/gen"
)

// AgentClient is a client for communicating with the remote agent
type AgentClient struct {
    // ...
    client gen.SnoozeAgentClient
    // ...
}
```

Updated all request/response struct references to use the `gen` package versions to ensure consistency.

## Impact

These fixes resolve the compilation errors identified in the Snoozebot 0.1.0 release plan. The code now properly uses the protobuf-generated types and follows the correct struct field access patterns.

## Next Steps

- Update examples to reflect the current API
- Complete test cases for the fixed functionality
- Continue with the remaining items in the release plan
