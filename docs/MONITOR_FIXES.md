# Monitor Code Type Conflict Fixes

This document describes the type conflicts in the monitor code that were fixed as part of the 0.1.0 release preparation.

## Overview of Fixes

Several type conflicts were addressed in the monitor package:

1. **ResourceMonitorFunc vs CustomMonitorFunc**: Fixed by adding an adapter function
2. **Type Conflict with ResourceType**: Fixed by explicitly converting between package-specific ResourceType values
3. **Memory Monitor Unused Variable**: Fixed by removing the unused freePages variable

## Detailed Fixes

### 1. ResourceMonitorFunc vs CustomMonitorFunc Adapter

**Issue**: The monitor package defines its own `ResourceMonitorFunc` type, but the resources package uses a different `CustomMonitorFunc` type with the same signature.

**Fix**: Added an adapter function to convert between the two types:

```go
// Create an adapter to convert ResourceMonitorFunc to CustomMonitorFunc
adaptedFn := func(fn ResourceMonitorFunc) resources.CustomMonitorFunc {
    return func() (float64, error) {
        return fn()
    }
}(monitorFn)
resourceManager.AddCustomMonitor(name, adaptedFn)
```

### 2. Type Conflict with ResourceType

**Issue**: Both the monitor package and resources package define their own `ResourceType` type, causing conflicts when passing values between them.

**Fix**: Added explicit type conversion when passing ResourceType values between packages:

```go
// Convert resources.ResourceType to monitor.ResourceType
monitorResourceType := ResourceType(string(resourceType))
m.currentState.CurrentUsage[monitorResourceType] = &ResourceUsage{
    Type:      monitorResourceType,
    Value:     usage.Value,
    Timestamp: usage.Timestamp,
}
```

### 3. Memory Monitor Unused Variable

**Issue**: The memory_darwin.go file had an unused variable `freePages` that caused a compilation error.

**Fix**: Commented out the unused code to clarify that it's intentionally not used:

```go
if strings.Contains(line, "Pages free:") {
    // We're not using free pages in our calculation, so we're just skipping this
    // parts := strings.Split(line, ":")
    // if len(parts) >= 2 {
    //     freeStr := strings.TrimSpace(strings.Replace(parts[1], ".", "", -1))
    //     // Unused: freePages, _ = strconv.ParseUint(freeStr, 10, 64)
    // }
}
```

### 4. Added Stub Implementations for Platform-Specific Monitors

Created stub implementations for monitors that are only implemented on specific platforms:

- network_stub.go - For non-Linux platforms
- disk_stub.go - For non-Linux platforms 
- user_input_stub.go - For non-Linux platforms
- gpu_stub.go - For non-Linux platforms

These stub implementations provide dummy values when the actual resource monitoring is not available on the current platform.

## Impact

These fixes resolve the compilation errors in the monitor package, allowing the code to build correctly across different platforms. The changes maintain the functionality while ensuring type safety and proper encapsulation between packages.
