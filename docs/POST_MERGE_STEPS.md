- [x] Verify authentication system with actual API keys
- [x] Test TLS communication between main application and plugins
- [x] Verify signature verification with signed plugins

### 2. Update Documentation

- [x] Update main README.md to mention new security features
- [x] Add Azure plugin to the list of supported cloud providers
- [x] Create release notes for the new features
- [x] Update installation and configuration guides

### 3. CI/CD Updates

- [ ] Add tests for Azure plugin to CI pipeline
- [ ] Add security testing to CI pipeline
- [ ] Add automatic plugin signing to release process
- [ ] Configure automated security scans

## Medium-Term Tasks (Next 1-2 Weeks)

### 1. Integration Testing

- [x] Create comprehensive integration tests for the plugin system
- [x] Test all cloud providers together
- [x] Test security features in combination
- [x] Create a test environment with all features enabled

### 2. Performance Optimization

- [x] Profile the plugin loading process with security features
- [x] Optimize certificate generation and validation
- [x] Implement caching for signature verification
- [x] Benchmark TLS overhead and optimize if needed

### 3. User Experience Improvements

- [x] Create streamlined setup wizard for security features
- [x] Improve error messages for security-related issues
- [x] Add logging and monitoring for security events
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide for security features

## Long-Term Roadmap Items (Next 1-3 Months)

### 1. Versioned Plugin APIs

- [x] Design API versioning system
- [x] Implement version compatibility checking
- [x] Add API version information to plugin manifests
- [x] Update documentation for plugin developers
- [ ] Implement plugin auto-update mechanism for version compatibility

### 2. Plugin Marketplace

- [ ] Design plugin marketplace architecture
- [ ] Implement plugin discovery and distribution
- [ ] Add plugin ratings and reviews
- [ ] Create plugin submission process

### 3. Enhanced Security Features

- [ ] Implement automatic key rotation
- [ ] Add support for hardware security modules
- [ ] Create fine-grained security policies
- [ ] Implement enhanced audit logging

## Migration Guide

For users upgrading from versions without the security features:

1. **Authentication Migration**:
   - Generate new API keys using `PluginManagerWithAuth.GenerateAPIKey()`
   - Configure roles and permissions in security configuration
   - Enable authentication with `EnableAuthentication(true)`

2. **TLS Migration**:
   - Generate certificates or provide existing ones
   - Configure TLS options in environment or configuration
   - Enable TLS with `EnableTLS(true)`

3. **Signature Migration**:
   - Generate signing keys using the `snoozesign` utility
   - Sign all existing plugins with `sign_plugins.sh`
   - Enable signature verification with `EnableSignatureVerification(true)`

## Fallback Plan

If any issues are discovered after merging:

1. **Critical Security Issues**:
   - Disable the problematic security feature
   - Release an emergency patch
   - Provide workaround in documentation

2. **Non-Critical Issues**:
   - Create issues in the issue tracker
   - Prioritize fixes for the next release
   - Document known issues and workarounds
