## Implementation Details

### Plugin Manager

The `PluginManagerImpl` in `/agent/provider/manager.go` is the core of the plugin system, responsible for:

1. Loading plugins with `LoadPlugin` method
2. Unloading plugins with `UnloadPlugin` method
3. Retrieving loaded plugins with `GetPlugin` method
4. Listing loaded plugins with `ListPlugins` method
5. Discovering available plugins with `DiscoverPlugins` method

The implementation uses HashiCorp's go-plugin library to manage plugin processes and communication.

### Plugin Interface

The `CloudProvider` interface in `/agent/provider/provider.go` defines the contract that all cloud provider plugins must implement:

```go
type CloudProvider interface {
    GetInstanceInfo(ctx context.Context, instanceID string) (*InstanceInfo, error)
    StopInstance(ctx context.Context, instanceID string) error
    StartInstance(ctx context.Context, instanceID string) error
    GetProviderName() string
    GetProviderVersion() string
}
```

### gRPC Protocol

The gRPC protocol is defined in `/pkg/plugin/proto/cloud_provider.proto` and generated into Go code using the Protocol Buffers compiler. The protocol enables efficient, type-safe communication between the core application and plugins.

### Plugin Discovery

Plugin discovery is implemented in the `DiscoverPlugins` method of the PluginManager, scanning a designated plugins directory for executable files that can be loaded as plugins. The discovered plugins can then be loaded on-demand.

### Dynamic Loading

Plugins are loaded dynamically at runtime using the `LoadPlugin` method, which starts the plugin process, establishes a gRPC connection, and creates a client wrapper that implements the CloudProvider interface.

### REST API

The REST API for plugin management is implemented in `/agent/api/plugin_handlers.go`, providing endpoints for plugin discovery, loading, unloading, and listing.

## AWS Plugin Implementation

The AWS plugin is implemented in `/plugins/aws/main.go` and provides a reference implementation for other cloud provider plugins. It uses the AWS SDK for Go to interact with AWS EC2 instances.

## GCP Plugin Implementation

The GCP plugin is implemented in `/plugins/gcp/main.go` and demonstrates how to implement support for an additional cloud provider. It uses the Google Cloud Platform Go SDK to interact with GCP Compute Engine instances.

## Testing Infrastructure

The testing infrastructure includes:

1. Unit tests for the Plugin Manager in `/agent/provider/manager_test.go`
2. Integration tests for the plugin system in `/test/integration/plugin_integration_test.go`
3. Mock plugins for testing without actual cloud providers

## Build System

The build system includes:

1. A build script for plugins in `/scripts/build_plugins.sh`
2. Makefile targets for plugin development
3. A protocol buffer generation script in `/scripts/generate_proto.sh`

## Next Steps

The following steps are planned for future development:

1. Implement Azure plugin
2. Add authentication and security to the plugin API
3. Implement versioned plugin APIs
4. Create a plugin marketplace for community-developed plugins
5. Add performance benchmarks for the plugin system
6. Complete API documentation

## Conclusion

The Snoozebot plugin system provides a robust foundation for extending the functionality of the application to support multiple cloud providers. The system is designed to be extensible, maintainable, and secure, with comprehensive documentation and testing.
