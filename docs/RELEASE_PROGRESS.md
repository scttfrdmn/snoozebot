### 5. Created Plugin Adapter for Integration Tests
- Implemented PluginAdapter to bridge between pkg/plugin.CloudProvider and agent/provider.CloudProvider
- Updated LoadPlugin to use adapter when loading plugins
- Added ListInstances method to agent/provider.CloudProvider interface

### 6. Updated Examples to Reflect Current API
- Updated custom plugin example to use CloudInstanceInfo instead of InstanceInfo
- Added mandatory Shutdown method implementation to custom plugin example
- Added documentation notes about v0.1.0 requirements

### 7. Added Cloud Provider Credential Setup
- Created comprehensive guides for AWS, Azure, and GCP credentials setup
- Developed shell scripts to automate credential configuration for all providers

- Added security best practices for credential management

## Remaining Tasks

### Phase 3: Testing Framework
- [x] **Unit Testing**
  - [x] Fix existing unit tests

- [x] **Integration Testing**
  - [x] Create tests for cross-plugin communication
  - [x] Test plugin loading with security features

### Phase 4: Live Provider Testing
- [x] **Cloud Provider Test Environments**
  - [x] Set up test environments for AWS, Azure, and GCP

- [ ] **Test Scenarios**
  - [ ] Test VM lifecycle management
  - [ ] Test error handling
  - [ ] Test authentication boundaries
  - [ ] Measure performance

- [ ] **Security Validation**
  - [ ] Test plugin communication security
  - [ ] Validate signature verification process
  - [ ] Test TLS certificate validation
  - [ ] Verify authentication controls

### Phase 5: Documentation & Packaging
- [ ] **Release Preparation**
  - [ ] Create tagged release v0.1.0
  - [ ] Generate checksum files
  - [ ] Prepare detailed changelog
  - [ ] Create release package

## Next Steps

The next priorities should be:

1. Set up test environments for cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)
2. Test VM lifecycle management with real providers
3. Validate security measures and authentication boundaries
4. Prepare for final release packaging

All major compilation errors have been resolved, and the code is now in a much more stable state. The examples have been updated to reflect the current API, making it easier for developers to create compatible plugins.
