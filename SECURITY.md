## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Snoozebot, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. Email the security team at `security@snoozebot.example.com` with details about the vulnerability

4. If possible, include suggestions for mitigating or fixing the issue

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours and will send you regular updates about our progress.

## Security Features

Snoozebot includes several security features that you should be aware of:

### Plugin Authentication

The plugin system includes authentication to prevent unauthorized plugins from being loaded. See [AUTHENTICATION_USAGE.md](docs/AUTHENTICATION_USAGE.md) for details.

### TLS Communication

Plugin communication is secured using TLS to protect against eavesdropping and tampering. See [PLUGIN_TLS.md](docs/PLUGIN_TLS.md) for details.

### Plugin Signature Verification

Plugins are signed and verified to ensure their authenticity and integrity. See [PLUGIN_SIGNATURES.md](docs/PLUGIN_SIGNATURES.md) for details.

### Role-Based Permissions

Plugins are restricted to performing only the operations allowed by their assigned role. This helps limit the potential impact of a compromised plugin.

### Process Isolation

Each plugin runs in a separate process to provide isolation and prevent a compromised plugin from affecting the main application.

## Security Best Practices

When deploying Snoozebot, we recommend following these security best practices:

1. **Enable authentication**: Always enable plugin authentication in production environments.
2. **Use strong API keys**: Generate long, random API keys for plugins.
3. **Secure configuration files**: Restrict access to the security configuration file.
4. **Regular key rotation**: Regularly rotate API keys for plugins.
5. **Principle of least privilege**: Only assign the minimum necessary permissions to plugins.
6. **Monitor logs**: Watch for unauthorized plugin loading attempts.
7. **Keep up to date**: Regularly update Snoozebot to get the latest security fixes.

## Future Security Enhancements

We are working on the following security enhancements:

1. **Enhanced auditing**: Improved logging of security-relevant events.
2. **Two-factor authentication**: Additional authentication factors for sensitive operations.
3. **Certificate rotation**: Automatic rotation of TLS certificates.
4. **Hardware security integration**: Support for hardware security modules (HSMs).
5. **Policy-based security**: Fine-grained security policies for plugins.

## Third-Party Dependencies

Snoozebot relies on several third-party dependencies. We regularly review and update these dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.

Key dependencies:
- HashiCorp go-plugin: Used for plugin architecture
- gRPC: Used for plugin communication
- Golang standard library: Used for core functionality

## Compliance

Snoozebot is designed to help you comply with your security requirements. While we do not currently hold specific certifications, we follow industry best practices for security.
